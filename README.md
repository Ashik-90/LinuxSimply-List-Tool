# ListSimply
Hello! Iâ€™m introducing ListSimply which is an update of the previous ListTool. From now you can use it to generate schema also. I hope it will save a lot of your time.

<h2>New Features:</h2>
1. It can automatically skip list and bash code (keeps normal code) while generating schema.
2. Intelligently resolves double quote errors that many of us face frequently.
3. Can detect if you miss a tag while copying from WP.
4. Removes unnecessary formatting from schema like justification and bold
5. Flexible to use when your FAQ questions and answers are justified or not, correctly spaced or not, it can fix all.
6. The generated schema will be automatically copied to your clipboard for faster pasting.

<h2>How to Use:</h2>
Just copy and paste the HTML from the starting **h3** of your first question until the end of the last answer. <br>
