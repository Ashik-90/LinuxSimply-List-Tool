# ListSimply
Hello! Iâ€™m introducing ListSimply which is an update of the previous ListTool. From now you can use it to generate schema also. I hope it will save a lot of your time.

<h2>New Features:</h2>
<ol>
<li> It can automatically skip list and bash code (keeps normal code) while generating schema.</li>
<li> Intelligently resolves double quote errors that many of us face frequently.</li>
 <li> Can detect if you miss a tag while copying from WP.</li>
<li> Removes unnecessary formatting from schema like justification and bold. </li>
 <li> Flexible to use when your FAQ questions and answers are justified or not, correctly spaced or not, it can fix all. </li>
 <li> The generated schema will be automatically copied to your clipboard for faster pasting. </li> </ol>
